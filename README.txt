The Writing Nook

Hello and welcome to the Writing Nook! Cozy up and enjoy a good story. Or, if you're feeling brave, post your own and watch everybody's positive, glowing reviews roll in!

Engineer Notes:
The Writing Nook is currently a work in process, created and developed entirely by me. My focus has been on functionality over style for now. I plan to add my own artwork when I reach the design and CSS phase.
The Writing Nook was made using a main tech stack of Javascript, React, Redux.

Features:
The Library page features all stories currently posted to the Writing Nook database. Users can search for stories by title, tag, or author name. Users can also view stories and, if they're logged in, leave reviews, ratings, and add stories to lists. Each story displays an average rating.
Once a user is logged in, they can post stories, delete stories, edit stories, view lists and previous ratings, and edit any previous ratings and comments. A user can also edit their profile page and view the profiles of others.
